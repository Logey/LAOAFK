# LAOAFK
Lost Ark Online AFK script created with AutoHotKey. Simply clicks your screen every now and then to prevent you from getting kicked, designed to keep you in-game and avoid the current queue issue in EU Central servers.

---

## Setup
1. Install [AutoHotKey](https://www.autohotkey.com/).
2. [Download the .ahk file](https://github.com/Logey/LAOAFK/releases/download/v1.0/laoafk.AHK).
3. Open the .ahk file in a text editor (even Notepad is fine).
4. Configure to your liking by editing the 'user-defined settings' section.
    - You mainly want to make sure the `X` and `Y` variables are set to the center of your screen (half your screen resolution; `X` is width - `Y` is height). The rest you may leave as is.
5. Run the .ahk file.
6. Click **Enable**!
   - You can now leave your computer and come back without worrying about needing to re-queue.

## Features
- Prevents you from getting kicked from Lost Ark by the AFK timer!
- Clicks happen at random times, at random coordinates, a random amount of times. This makes it less obvious that it's not a human making these inputs.
    - The ranges for the randomness can be configured by editing the .ahk file.

## Notes
- Using macros and scripts like this one is against Lost Ark's TOS. From experience you are unlikely to receive a ban for using this, but know that it is possible and I am not responsible for what you do on your account.
- There is a bug that may prevent you from re-enabling the script too soon after disabling it. If this happens, you can simply close the window and re-open it.
